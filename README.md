# Virtual Display Driver
Based on Microsoft Indirect Display Driver Sample. This creates a virtual display in Windows that acts and functions just like a real one. It's useful for streaming, virtual reality applications, recording, headless servers, etc. The benefit over a physical display is the ability to adjust resolutions and refresh rates beyond the physical displays capabilities. For example, this would enable the ability to stream a game from your home PC using game streaming software at 240hz at 8K while owning a 60hz 1080p monitor (unrealistic, but explains the abilities well). For servers without displays, this enabled remote desktop and screen streaming to other systems as if there were a display installed. 

Supports emulating resolutions from **640 x 480** to **7680 x 4320 (8K)**, and refresh rates including **60hz, 75hz, 90hz, 120hz, 144hz, 165hz, 240hz, 480hz,** and **500hz.**

This project uses the official Windows Indirect Display Driver combined with the IddCx class extension driver.

## Easy Uninstall

1. Open device manager
2. Locate Display Adapters
3. Right click on IddSampleDriver, choose "Uninstall device"
4. There is a new popup window, in there click Attempt to remove driver for this device.


## Manual/Forced Uninstall

Next instructions are for those cases where the device is removed from the system, but driver stil remains. This happens when there is a connection to the device while trying to remove the drivers. To
remedy this, there is a a few tricks built into windows. So here goes:

1. Open up a powershell terminal and input this:
2.  ```pnputil /enum-drivers```
3. Locate iddsampledriver.inf, there might be multiple pages of text. Make a note of the "published name", it's often unique for your system, but might look like "oem139.inf"
4.  ```pnputil /delete-driver oem139.inf```
5.  (If you still get multiple displays after uninstall, try to repeat uninstall procedure in safemode.)



## Removing Certificates (Optional)

To uninstall the root certificate:

1. Search for "Manage computer certificates" from the Start menu and open the app.
2. In the sidebar, expand `Trusted Root Certification Authorities` -> `Certificates` folder.
3. Scroll to the bottom, until you see "Virtual Display Driver".
4. Right click "Virtual Display Driver" and hit "Delete". In the warning that appears, choose "Yes".
5. In the sidebar, expand `Trusted Publishers` -> `Certificates` folder.
6. Scroll to the bottom, until you see "Virtual Display Driver". 
7. Right click "Virtual Display Driver" and hit "Delete". In the warning that appears, choose "Yes".
